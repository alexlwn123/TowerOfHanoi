# TowerOfHanoi
Classic Tower of Hanoi played entirely in console output. Created in Java.


This was a project that I created in my first Java class in high school. It was finished in April, 2017.


Compile and Run "TowerOfHanoi.java" to start the game.

Play the game as instructed. 


There is a secret "Cheat Code" that will utilize the "TowerSolver.java" file. When the player is prompted for a number of rings, if the player inputs the string "nickelbackistheonlygod" and then enters a number of rings, the game will auto-complete with a perfect solution.
